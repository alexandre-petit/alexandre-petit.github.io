							<h3 class="major">Improving Tackling Technique</h3>
							<p>This year NFL Big Data Bowl focus on improving the tackle technique efficiency. The goal is to share actionable insight that can be used by NFL trainers to improve their defense</p>
							<h3 class="major">The Data</h3>
							<p>The data consist of thirteen tables. The results of the games, the players informations, plays, and tackles. In addition, nine tables track all the players during the games. The orientation of the players is determined by the sensors placed on both shoulders. However, some players such as Patrick Mahomes have a great mobility which allows them to run in a direction different than the one they are facing. This can lead to error in the analysis if we use the orientation as the direction the players are facing.</p>
							<h3>The Science of Tackling</h3>
							<p>What makes a great tackle? First, we need to accept that there is no one size fits all for tackling. Stopping the run of a Wide Receiver on the side of the field and blocking a Quarterback trying to go through the middle of the defense are two completely different things.</p>
							<h3 class="major">Player Positions and Orientation</h3>
							<p>The coordinates of the players are indicated on the field length (x-axis) and field width (y-axis). The origin of the axis the corner of the field bordering the home endzone and the home sideline. The orientation increases in the clockwise rotation. A value of 0 for the orientation correspond to a player facing the visitor sideline.</p>
